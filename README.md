# tic-tac-toe-game
tie tac toe game for fun
I am trying to make a simple tic tac toe game using HTML5, CSS3, jQuery and Javascript with a nice and friendly interface. 
The purpose of this project is for improving my programming skills with regards to front-end development. 
ideally, the project should have following features:
Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter

* Allow players to customize their tokens (X, O, name, picture, etc)---------------done

* Get inventive with your styling, e.g. use hover effects or animations to spiff things up -------------------not yet

Use LocalStorage to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet

connectivity ---------------------not yet

Support custom board sizes: default is 3x3 but you could allow users to choose a larger board --------------------not yet

Support networked multiplayer: https://www.firebase.com/ has a nice quickstart guide -------------------------------------not yet

TRICKIEST: Create an AI opponent: teach Javascript to play an unbeatable game against you ------------------------------------not yet
